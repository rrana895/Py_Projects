>> ##  Web Scraping
>> A program or script pretends to be a browser and retrieves web pages, looks at those web pages, extracts info, and then looks at more web pages. 
>>> ## Why Scrape?? ðŸ¤”
>> Pull data
>> Monitor a site for new info
>> Get own data out of some system that has no "export capability"
>> Scrape the web to make a database for a search engine
Be careful ðŸ¤¨ some do not like the scraping though.

>> There is also package called Beautiful Soup. 
>> Here have used urllib module which is pre installed so need for installation. In the code have collected data from the  [webpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes%27_list_of_the_world%27s_highest-paid_athletes). To view the data that's scraped used head(), and finally saved the scraped data in a CSV file.
